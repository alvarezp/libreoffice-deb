Description: high-quality office productivity suite 1.1 beta
 *** OpenOffice.org 1.1 experimental packages ***
 .
 These are preliminary packages which are still under development and not yet
 ready for Debian unstable.  They are installable alongside the existing 1.0.x
 versions, which you should continue to use for mission-critical data.
 Documents created by 1.1 are fully compatible with OpenOffice.org 1.0.x.
 .
 This is a beta OpenOffice.org release from the 1.1 beta2 branch.  The final
 version is currently scheduled for August 2003.  The 1.1 branch contains many
 new features; here are a few:
  * Native export to PDF, Flash and XHTML formats
  * Macro recorder
  * Improved import/export of Microsoft(R) Office formats
  * Import/export of XML formats including DocBook
  * CTL (Complex text layout) support
  * Support for mobile device formats
  * Improved clipboard support
  * Font rendering support can be configured by environment variables
  * Czech language support
  * Many, many bug fixes and usability improvements
 .
 For more information about 1.1 see
 http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.1beta/index.html
 .
 OpenOffice.org 1.1 is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office. Users report that little
 or no training is required for people migrating from other office suites -
 everything works the way people expect.
 .
 You can extend the functionality of OpenOffice.org by installing these
 packages:
  * x-ttcidfont-conf: Makes all defoma-registered fonts on your system
    available to OpenOffice.org
  * openoffice.org-spellcheck: Myspell dictionaries for use with OpenOffice.org
  * openoffice.org-help: User help; available in several languages from
     http://linux-debian.de/openoffice
  * menu: Will add openoffice.org menu entries for every Debian window manager.
  * ooqstart-gnome: Quick start applet for Gnome desktops
  * unixodbc: ODBC database support
  * cupsys-bsd: Allows OpenOffice.org to detect your CUPS printer queues
     automatically
  * libsane: Use your sane-supported scanner with OpenOffice.org
  * gs: You can set up a generic PDF printer queue using ghostscript to export
     PDF files.
