The orig.tar.gz was created by running http://people.debian.org/~rene/create_ooo2_orig.sh.
It consists of the four seperate tarballs from http://go-oo.org of whose
some non-free stuff has been removed (see the script)

In addition, http://people.debian.org/~rene/openoffice.org/2.0.4/cws-sdwexc01.diff was appplied which fixes a regression on Solaris and was introduced after
m5 (and m5 retagged and new official source tarball released).
(Solaris only, but .orig is .orig..)
