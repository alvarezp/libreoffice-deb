Type: note
_Description: Component registries might be corrupted
 You are upgrading from a version which might have corrupted
 service/component registry files (*.rdb), especially
 /var/lib/openoffice/basis3.1/program/services.rdb and the rdb files
 in /var/spool/openoffice/uno_packages/cache for installed extensions.
 .
 If you experience problems with the component manager or segmentation faults
 involving libstore in either unopkg or OpenOffice.org, please check these
 files. Try cleanly reinstalling the packages and/or using a clean user
 profile.
