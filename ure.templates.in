_Description: Component registries might be corrupted
 You are upgrading from a version which might have corrupted
 service/component registry files (*.rdb).
 .
 Especially /var/lib/openoffice/basis3.1/program/services.rdb and the rdbs
 below /var/spool/openoffice/uno_packages/cache for installed extensions.
 .
 If you experience problems with the component manager or segmentation faults
 in either unopkg or OOo which involve store, please check those
 (and eventually cleanly reinstall the packages and/or use a clean user profile)
