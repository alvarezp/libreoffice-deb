01. Port OpenOffice.org on powerpc to gcc3. In the module bridges there is
    assembly code, which has not yet been ported to gcc3. I talked to Kevin
    B. Hendricks, the whoswho of OpenOffice.org on powerpc, and he told me,
    that he does not plan to do the port for gcc 3.0.4 and is concentrating
    on being ready for gcc 3.1. Jan will help him.

02. We have a report about ugly fonts after installation. We have not yet
    investigated this problem to find a fix.
    We need to look at SAL_FONT_PATH variable.
    Also, see the font troubleshooting FAQ at
    http://www.openoffice.org/files/documents/16/63/FontTroubleshooting-v2.pdf
    
03. Where should the configuration files go?
    Tim Wheeler pointed out, that the splash screen should be disabled.
    Showing the splashscreen couses a high load on his computer (Athlon
    1.2GHz). In this issue he asks about the location of the
    config-files. They should be saved global in /etc. sofficerc is in
    /usr/lib/openoffice.org/program is a kandidate for /etc/openoffice.
    The name of the dir in /etc could be changed to openoffice.org :)
    
    I'm not really sure that it is splashscreen that makes a load. --Nidd.
    The splash screen does not cause the load, but it stays in front of other
    windows while Openoffice.org is loading... --Chris

04. Tim Wheeler also mentioned:
    I had to add /usr/lib/openoffice/program to /etc/ld.so.conf so that i
    could run spadmin (to add fonts).  i couldn't find a wrapper/link to
    /usr/lib/openoffice/program/spadmin.bin.
    
    We will fix this when we start looking at the file locations.  Most files
    are still in their default locations as installed by openoffice setup.
    Many of these locations are not correct for a Debian system and are not
    necessarily FHS compliant.

    You can work around this by running spadmin like this:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/openoffice/program /usr/lib/openoffice/program/spadmin.bin

05. OpenOffice.org ready for debian main?

    Peter Novodvorski is working on patches for two problems that will let
    OpenOffice.org be put into main.  He has created a Java removal patch, but
    Chris has not yet had time to test and integrate it into the package.
    
    The problems we have are two build dependencies: Java 1.3.1 and libgcpl0.
    Both packages are non-free, which means that currently OpenOffice.org can
    only be uploaded to contrib.  The gpcl dependency has been removed.
    Unfortunately, that means that 3D filled polygons do not print with our
    packages.

07. Upload OpenOffice.org to debian experimental?

    If we decide to upload OpenOffice.org to experimental, we have the
    advantage of the debian-BTS for handling bugs.  But we are not ready to
    do this yet.  However, we are using the PTS to track bugs that are filed to
    the Debian BTS.

08. Problems with setup
    The openoffice script tries to start setup if it has not already been
    run, but this fails if a previous version was already installed.  If you
    have problems, please check that you do not have any old installations
    around, and delete ~/.sversionrc. 
    Will work on this. --Nidd.

09. Other languages.  See http://lang.openoffice.org

    Several language packs have been built, but the language is not yet
    automatically changed.

    There still seem to be some problems with the language pack generation.  In
    particular, I spotted these files that don't get put in the language packs;
    I added them to the install list for the openoffice.org package, but only
    the English language files:

    usr/lib/openoffice/program/resource/iso64101.res
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/sun.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/th_en_US.dat
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/th_en_US.idx
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/en_US.aff
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/en_US.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_da.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_de.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_en.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_ru.dic

    So foreign language dictionaries are not yet available in the .debs.

11. Problems with S3 Savage chip
    If you are running XFree86 4.x and have an S3 Savage chip, you must use
    this workaround.  Export this variable before starting openoffice:
    SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true
    export SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50

    If you do not do this, OOo will not work and the Xserver will eventually
    hang.  If you are very unlucky, the machine must be _powered off_ and
    rebooted to clear the problem!

    Alternatively, you can install XFree86 4.2, or update the driver to
    version 1.1.20 or above from:
    http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html

12. KDE/GNOME integration
    The desktop integration has not yet been done.  The files are not put
    into the correct places yet.

    We have removed the icons for now, because they were causing many errors
    during user setup.  John Cooper has already created menu and mime entries -
    install the Debian menu package to see the menu entries.  Mandrake have
    improved the integration in their packages; we will be able to adapt that
    for our use in a future version.

13. ODBC libraries
    It was pointed out that OOo possibly looks for libodbc.so, which is only
    available in the lib*-dev package.  More details at this bug report:

    http://bugs.debian.org/138453

15. libstlport4.5
    On i386 architecture, the libstlport shared library that is needed for
    Openoffice.org must be compiled with gcc 3, due to the ABI change.  This
    library is available from the apt archive, too.  Currently, this
    conflicts with the libstlport built with gcc 2.95, which means you cannot
    install Openoffice.org and packages that depend on libstlport4.5
    (libboost-xxx).  We need to change the soname for this library.        

16. Remove libraries from the package which are already available in Debian.

17. There are some warning messages which are fairly harmless, but can be
    confusing when trying to locate other problems:

    sh: /usr/sbin/lpc: No such file or directory
    sh: lpc: command not found
    sh: lpstat: command not found

    Also: chkfontpath

18. Gnome session manager problem - OOo shuts down spontaneously
    http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4494
    There is a workaround in the openoffice script which unsets SESSION_MANAGER
    if gnome-session is the session manager.
