01. Port OpenOffice.org on powerpc to gcc3. In the module bridges there is
    assembly code, which has not yet been ported to gcc3. I talked to Kevin
    B. Hendricks, the whoswho of OpenOffice.org on powerpc, and he told me,
    that he does not plan to do the port for gcc 3.0.4 and is concentrating
    on being ready for gcc 3.1. Jan will help him.

02. We have a report about ugly fonts after installation. We have not yet
    investigated this problem to find a fix.
    We need to look at SAL_FONT_PATH variable.
    
03. Where should the configuration files go?
    Tim Wheeler pointed out, that the splash screen should be disabled.
    Showing the splashscreen couses a high load on his computer (Athlon
    1.2GHz). In this issue he asks about the location of the
    config-files. They should be saved global in /etc. sofficerc is in
    /usr/lib/openoffice.org/program is a kandidate for /etc/openoffice.
    The name of the dir in /etc could be changed to openoffice.org :)
    
    I'm not really sure that it is splashscreen that makes a load. --Nidd.

04. Tim Wheeler also mentioned:
    I had to add /usr/lib/openoffice/program to /etc/ld.so.conf so that i
    could run spadmin (to add fonts).  i couldn't find a wrapper/link to
    /usr/lib/openoffice/program/spadmin.bin.
    
    We will fix this when we start looking at the file locations.  Most files
    are still in their default locations as installed by openoffice setup.
    Many of these locations are not correct for a Debian system and are not
    necessarily FHS compliant.

    You can work around this by running spadmin like this:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/openoffice/program /usr/lib/openoffice/program/spadmin.bin

05. OpenOffice.org ready for debian main?

    Peter Novodvorski is working on patches for two problems that will let
    OpenOffice.org be put into main. The problems we have are two
    build dependencies: Java 1.3.1 and libgcpl0. Both packages
    are non-free, which means that currently OpenOffice.org can only be
    uploaded to contrib.  Since Openoffice.org is due to release 1.0 in the
    next week or so, we will not be able to get rid of these in time for the
    release.  Hopefully it will be possible to announce Openoffice.org for
    main soon :)
    gpc patch is already in CVS --Nidd.
    it is in the 1.0 .deb :) --Chris

07. Upload OpenOffice.org to debian experimental?

    If we decide to upload OpenOffice.org to experimental, we have the
    advantage of the debian-BTS for handling bugs.  But we are not ready to
    do this yet.
    So, please, if you have some reports, bugs or issues, mail them to
    debian-openoffice@lists.debian.org.

08. Problems with setup
    The openoffice script tries to start setup if it has not already been
    run, but this fails if a previous version was already installed.  If you
    have problems, please check that you do not have any old installations
    around, and delete ~/.sversionrc. 
    Will work on this. --Nidd.

09. Other languages.  See http://lang.openoffice.org
    There is simple support for building .debs for other supported languages
    by changing the language number in debian/scripts/vars:
    
    BUILDLANG=01
    
    Change 01 to the country code for the language that you wish to build
    for, e.g. 49 for German, then rebuild the deb.
    We need to improve this process so that several languages can be built at
    once, and .debs with different names generated.
    You also need to edit /etc/openoffice/autoresponse.conf and change
    LAGUAGELIST=01 to your language code.

    It appears the language files are in <openoffice-root>/program/resource.

11. Problems with S3 Savage chip
    If you are running XFree86 4.x and have an S3 Savage chip, you must use
    this workaround.  Export this variable before starting openoffice:
    SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true
    export SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50

    If you do not do this, OOo will not work and the Xserver will eventually
    hang.  If you are very unlucky, the machine must be _powered off_ and
    rebooted to clear the problem!

    Alternatively, you can install XFree86 4.2, or update the driver to
    version 1.1.20 or above from:
    http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html

12. KDE/GNOME integration
    The desktop integration has not yet been done.  The files are not put
    into the correct places yet.

    There are details of the steps needed here:
    http://installation.openoffice.org/how_to_repackage_oo.html

13. ODBC libraries
    It was pointed out that OOo possibly looks for libodbc.so, which is only
    available in the lib*-dev package.  More details at this bug report:

    http://bugs.debian.org/138453

14. Breaking up openoffice.org?
    The package is currently the biggest in Debian to date!  We will look at
    breaking the package into smaller pieces, but there will probably still
    be quite a large openoffice.org-core package (100-180MB unpacked?) that is
    needed whichever application is installed.

    A tip from http://installation.openoffice.org/how_to_repackage_oo.html:

    To split the file list into two, you should include all files in
    <path-to-openoffice-root>/program/resource  and the
    <path-to-openoffice-root>/share tree into  the language package list and
    the rest into the binary package list.

15. libstlport4.5
    On i386 architecture, the libstlport shared library that is needed for
    Openoffice.org must be compiled with gcc 3, due to the ABI change.  This
    library is available from the apt archive, too.  Currently, this
    conflicts with the libstlport built with gcc 2.95, which means you cannot
    install Openoffice.org and packages that depend on libstlport4.5
    (libboost-xxx).  We need to change the soname for this library.
