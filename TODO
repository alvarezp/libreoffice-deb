*   OpenOffice.org ready for debian contrib?

    We cannot move into main until we solve the Java build dependency (see
    below), but the packages are ready to go into Debian contrib (the archive
    section for packages with non-free dependencies but are free themselves).
    We are currently trying to build OpenOffice.org with GCC 3.2, which is due
    to be released shortly, and will upload when that is complete.

*   OpenOffice.org ready for debian main?

    Peter Novodvorski is working on patches for two problems that will let
    OpenOffice.org be put into main.  He has created a Java removal patch, but
    Chris has not yet had time to test and integrate it into the package.
    
    The problems we have are two build dependencies: Java 1.3.1 and libgcpl0.
    Both packages are non-free, which means that currently OpenOffice.org can
    only be uploaded to contrib.  The gpcl dependency has been removed.
    Unfortunately, that means that 3D filled polygons do not print with our
    packages.

    The Java patch is not yet complete.

*   Upload OpenOffice.org to debian experimental?

    If we decide to upload OpenOffice.org to experimental, we have the
    advantage of the debian-BTS for handling bugs.  But we are not ready to
    do this yet.  However, we are using the PTS to track bugs that are filed to
    the Debian BTS.  Chris is waiting to get Debian maintainer status, at which
    point it will be much easier for this to happen.

*   Other languages.  See http://lang.openoffice.org

    There still seem to be some problems with the language pack generation.  In
    particular, I spotted these files that don't get put in the language packs;
    I added them to the install list for the openoffice.org package, but only
    the English language files:

    usr/lib/openoffice/program/resource/iso64101.res
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/sun.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/th_en_US.dat
    usr/lib/openoffice/share/wordbook/english/th_en_US.idx
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/en_US.aff
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/en_US.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_da.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_de.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_en.dic
    usr/lib/openoffice/user/wordbook/hyph_ru.dic

    Foreign language dictionaries are not yet available in the .debs.  Now that
    we have moved to the shared dictionary system, it will be easier to start
    packaging dictionaries.  Rene Engelhard has already packaged German
    dictionaries.

*   Problems with S3 Savage chip
    If you are running XFree86 4.x and have an S3 Savage chip, you must use
    this workaround.  Export this variable before starting openoffice:
    SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true
    export SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50

    If you do not do this, OOo will not work and the Xserver will eventually
    hang.  If you are very unlucky, the machine must be _powered off_ and
    rebooted to clear the problem!

    Alternatively, you can install XFree86 4.2, or update the driver to
    version 1.1.20 or above from:
    http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html

*   GNOME integration
    KDE integration seems to be complete; Gnome integration needs to be tested.

*   libstlport4.5
    On i386 architecture, the libstlport shared library that is needed for
    Openoffice.org must be compiled with gcc 3, due to the ABI change.  This
    library is available from the apt archive, too.  Currently, this
    conflicts with the libstlport built with gcc 2.95, which means you cannot
    install Openoffice.org and packages that depend on libstlport4.5
    (libboost-xxx).  We need to change the soname for this library.  Update:
    we'll probably wait for the release of gcc3.2 before uploading to the
    Debian archive.

*   Remove libraries from the package which are already available in Debian.

*   There are some warning messages which are fairly harmless, but can be
    confusing when trying to locate other problems:

    sh: /usr/sbin/lpc: No such file or directory
    sh: lpc: command not found
    sh: lpstat: command not found

    Also: chkfontpath

*   Gnome session manager problem - OOo shuts down spontaneously
    http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4494
    There is a workaround in the openoffice script which unsets SESSION_MANAGER
    if gnome-session is the session manager.

*   Improve font integration with other packages, such as ttf-openoffice
