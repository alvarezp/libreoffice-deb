_Description: Architecture doesn't support "NaN passing"
 LibreOffice Calc relies on a feature called "NaN passing" which is optional
 in the IEEE 754 standard. Your architecture (riscv64) does not support it, though.
 .
 This package is shipped nevertheless for use cases where this does not matter
 but you should be aware that Calc can give you wrong results, especially
 with =IFERROR() etc.
