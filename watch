# only releases (and the final rc before the release. The last rc simply get renamed
# so e.g. 6.4.3 final is 6.4.3 rc2 which is 6.4.3.2)
# FIXME:
# Unfortunately it seems that download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/src gets the rcs too. But
# download.documentfoundation.org/stable((\d.\d.\d) doesn't work since we then get no tarball information
# as that doesn't ship the source... And I fail getting parsing of www.libreoffice.org/download to work
