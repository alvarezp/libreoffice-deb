Description: transitional package for MariaDB/MySQL Connector extension for LibreOffice
 LibreOffice is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package used to contain the LibreOffice MySQL/MariaDB Connector extension.
 This has now been folded added to "main" packages (libreoffice-sdbc-mysql)
 and this package thus can be safely removed once installed.
