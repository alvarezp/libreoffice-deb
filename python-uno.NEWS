libreoffice (1:3.5.2-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The script provider for python (which was in python-uno before has been
    split out into libreoffice-script-provider-python as it's the same in both
    variants and python-uno should contain just the module anyway.  

    If you relied on python-uno for the script provider, install the new
    package in addition.
