Description: OpenOffice.org extension for size-efficient presentations
 OpenOffice.org is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package contains the presentation minimizer extension:
  "The Sun Presentation Minimizer is used to reduce the file size of the
  current presentation. Images will be compressed, and data that is no longer
  needed will be removed.
  The Sun Presentation Minimizer can optimize the image quality size.
  Presentations designed for screen or projector do not require the same high
  quality as presentations designed for print."
