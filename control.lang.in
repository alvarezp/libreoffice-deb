Description: @LNAME@ language package for openoffice.org
 OpenOffice is a complete modern office suite, licensed under the GPL, with
 features comparable to Microsoft(R) Office features.
 .
 This package contains the localization of openoffice.org in @LNAME@. 
 It contains the user interface, the help, the templates and the autotext
 features. (please note that not all this is available for all possible
 language).  You can switch user interface language using the locales system.
 .
 Spelling dictionaries other than US English are not distributed with the main
 OpenOffice.org source due to licensing differences.  There are some available
 in separate packages (openoffice.org-spellcheck-<language>).  If you just want
 to be able to spellcheck in other languages, you can install extra
 dictionaries independently of the language packs.
