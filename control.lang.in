Description: @LNAME@ language package for openoffice.org 1.1 beta
 *** OpenOffice.org 1.1 experimental packages ***
 .
 OpenOffice is a complete modern office suite, licensed under the GPL,
 with features comparable to Microsoft(R) Office features.
 .
 This package contains the localization of openoffice.org 1.1 beta in
 @LNAME@.  It contains the user interface, the help, the templates and
 the autotext features. (please note that not all this is available for
 all possible language).  You can switch user interface language using
 the locales system.
 .
 Spelling dictionaries other than US English are not distributed with the
 main OpenOffice.org source due to licensing differences.  There are some
 available in separate packages (openoffice.org-spellcheck-<language>).
 If you just want to be able to spellcheck in other languages, you can
 install extra dictionaries independently of the language packs.
