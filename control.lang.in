Description: @LNAME@ language package for OpenOffice.org
 OpenOffice.org is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package contains the localization of OpenOffice.org in
 @LNAME@. 
 It contains the user interface, the templates and the autotext features.
 (please note that not all this is available for all possible languages). 
 You can switch user interface language using the locales system.
 .
 Spelling dictionaries, hyphenation patterns, thesauri and help are not
 included in this package. There are some available in separate packages
 (myspell-*, openoffice.org-hyphenation-*, openoffice.org-thesaurus-*,
 openoffice.org-help-*)
 .
 If you just want to be able to spellcheck etc. in other languages, you can
 install extra dictionaries/hyphenation patterns/thesauri independently of
 the language packs.
