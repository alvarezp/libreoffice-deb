    the packages to coexist until we replace 1.0.x
  * Add links created by OOo setup app to MANIFEST file lists and
    include in openoffice.org1.1.install
  * setperms: add new script names.  chmod lines removed from rules.
  * Build with internal stlport until a build error is fixed
  * Some files that would otherwise conflict with the 1.0.x packages are
    temporarily removed (Icons and KDE shortcuts).  Gnome files renamed.
  * Add to build-depends: libcrimson-java, libxalan-java, libxalan2-java
    (needed for JDK < 1.4)
  * shorten some lines in long descriptions (Rene)
  * split KDE mimelinks out to openoffice.org1.1-mimelink to avoid file
    conflicts with koffice wanting to have them for OOo import; now
    OOo and KOffice can use the ones of this package, thanks Ben
    Burton for pointing that problem out (Rene)
  * Fix permissions when unpacking source by adding detect_java.sh to setperms
  * Add configimport utiltity to -bin for updating the OOo configuration from
    the command line
