      /usr/share/doc/openoffice.org-dev-doc with symlink from "old" location

    - add -Python-Version: current for new python policy
    - stop suggesting ooqstart-gnome at -gnome since we conflict with it,
      thanks Adam C Powell IV for noticing (closes: #370230); also don't talk
      about "Base" in -gnomes description.
  * debian/rules, debian/control*in:
    - for sarge backports move the packages to contrib since we use
      a non-free JDK as (build-)dependency.

      hunspell replaced myspell and we really don't need to link with

    - add Conflicts:/Replaces:/Provides: in -l10n-hi-in against -l10n-hi
    - bump hunspell package version number to 1.2-x since we need to get
      bigger and the 1.1 we have is functionally identical to 1.1. Temporary
      disable -hunspell because we'd need a epoch when we upload a rc to
      experimental and then to unstable. Avoid that, and reenable -hunspell
      when we upload 2.0.1 final.

    - remove versioned gcj-4.0, gij-4.0, libgcj6-dev and gjdoc  builddeps, we

openoffice.org (2.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * ooo-build/patches/src680/use-free-xt-xp-jaxp-from-system.diff:
    use xt-0.20050823.jar instead of xt.jar; on the buildds the files are

  * debian/rules:
    - the helpimgs are missing when we don't build with help so repack
      the zips and add them during the build.
    - start adding necessary conditionals for sarge backport; when building
      a sarge backport:
      - use gcc/g++ 3.3
      - use internal xmlsec, hunspell, hsqldb, bsh, mdbtools, xt, xp, xalan,
        xerces and portaudio
      - disable cairo canvas
      - (re)enable Java but use Blackdowns Java *ugh* to build (otherwise we'd
        need a gcc-4.0 backport, too...)
    - don't install libcommuni* and libsimplecm* if we don't package the
      testtool and actually set PACKAGE_TESTTOOL=n

    the sparc bridges

  * ooo-build/bin/package-ooo: don't install a wrapper script for jvmsetup
    which doesn't exist anymore (closes: #324160)
  * debian/control*in:
    - let -core conflict against openoffice.org2-l10n-1.9.1{08,14,21,25}.
      Needs better automatic solution...
    - let the langpacks conflict against the numerical previous and next
      -langpack versions
    - only Recommend openoffice.org-core, analogous to 1.1.x to make
      tasksel happy
    - add ${cli:Depends} to libuno-cil
    - Suggest c-shell at -dev to make lintian happy
    - add @LOCALES_DEPENDS@
    - add libmythes-dev
    - build-depend on libicu34-dev

      appropriate and needed
    - build-depend on g++-3.4 on sparc

    - only set a binsuffix when $(VER) is not empty; otherwise build
      with --with-binsuffix=no
    - change build-dependency against libcurl from libcurl3-dev to
      libcurl3-openssl-dev | libcurl3-dev to cope with the reorganization of
      the curl packages
  * debian/rules:
    - run dh_desktop...
    - suggest culmus for a prospective -he langpack
    - use -s instead of -a in binary-arch
    - fix installation of mono stuff (don't install the .dlls into -common...)
      and set MONO_SHARED_DIR for dh_clideps
    - chmod 755 setsdkenv_unix.*
    - do classmap creation, taken from eclipse, thanks. Still no effect,
      though...
    - enable cairo canvas build, disabled per default though
    - add extra sysui build step back because of changed upstream behaviour
    - enable rw, it doesn't work with "locales" but with
      "belocs-locales-data", so add a new LOCALES_DEPENDS variable letting
      it depending on belocs-locales-data and "the rest" on
      "locales | belocs-locales-data". Same for the other languages not
      supported by plain locales.
    - disable bs and lt, somehow doesn't work anymore, to be investigated
    - add preliminary support for builds without Java; useful for backports
      or for archs where Java still make problems
    - add the possibility to build a non-PIC version of libmythes here and
      to package libmythes-dev from here (if $(USE_EXTERNAL_MYTHES) != "y").
      Use that, updates of mythes would need a rebuild of OOo anyway so this
      is quite overkill.. Requested by Martin Pitt.
    - remove ooonologo installation, now done via ooo-build patch
    - add manpage symlink for ooffice, thanks Matthias Klose
    - add conditional to optionally build without STLport and use the "normal"
      STL.
    - add system-icu and system-xmlsec conditionals; enable both
    - move psprint.conf and sofficerc into /etc/openoffice; add a dummy
      sofficrc just referencing /etc/openoffice/sofficerc in ../program to
      make OOo work...
    - Remove the "<app> makes it possible" from the German desktop
      translations.
    - install (and create) GNOME .keys, .mime and .applications
    - install DicOOo
    - install dictionary.lst symlink (closes: #320831)
    - disable --with-system-sablot; breaks displaying of help, thanks Matthias
      Klose
    - export JAVA_HOME in debian/rules; otherwise the registration of
      the Java compponent somehow fail
    - several updates for 1.9.x -> 2.0; get desktop-integration version
      from productversion.mk directlay instead of from the changelog
    - use ooo-build-2-0 branch
    - if we build without Java, run the Javadoc buildstep manually and
      copy the files in install-indep; otherwise -dev-doc (_all) would
      eventually miss the Javadocs depending on where it was build...
  * debian/copyright: update FSF address, thanks lintian
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: update; override rpath warnings globally since
    we have different files with different names on the different archs and
    override csh-considered-harmful.
  * debian/openoffice.org-jars-native.post*.in: update
  * debian/shlibs.override.internal: override also libxmlsec1-nss

    /etc/bash_completion.d/openoffice; obsoleted by
    /etc/bash_completion.d/ooo-wrapper.sh and
    /etc/openoffice/autoresponse.conf (obsolete because there's no "setup"
    anymore)
  * debian/ttf-opensymbol.postinst.in: don't run fc-cache if fontconfig
    was not yet configured (closes: #303693)

    - does not stat any font twice anymore on cold startup (closes: #243659)
  * ooo-build/src:
    - translation updates from ftp.linux.cz again; get bg from
      wget http://icobgr.info/ooo/GSI_bg.sdf.bz2 directly since ftp.linux.cz's
      version is broken
  * debian/rules:
    - enable hunspell component. Fix to specify -Nopenoffice.org2-hunspell
      when we don't enable it. Fix typo preventing libhunspell-dev actually
      be added to %BUILD_DEPS%
    - generate setsdk_unix.{,c}sh
    - add mysql.jar, sapdbc-7.5.00.jar and postgresql.jar (from libmysql-java /
      libsapdbc7.5.01-java / libpg-java) to the CLASSPATH
    - remove stale SUGGESTS from debian/rules control. Exchange it with
      FONT_SUGGESTS; for now adding ttf-{bengali,gujarati,punjabi}-fonts to
      the Suggests of -bn / -pa-in / -gu-IN.
    - add debian/rules to the dependencies of the control target. debian/rules
      changes can make debian/control change, too (conditionals,
      @FONT_SUGGESTS@)
    - since ooo-build now has system-mdbtools implemented, add conditional for
      this; enable mdbtools support and build with system mdbtools
    - update cairo conditional
    - add missing , to some BUILD_DEPS settings
    - bump kdelibs4-dev builddep to >= 3.4.2 since there KDE has transitioned;
      eclipcitely build-dep on libgamin-dev to work around install problems
      with GNOME, thanks Adeodato Simo for the workaround and hint. Enable it.
    - handle gzip compressed GSIs
    - some conditional cleanup for Ubuntu, add BUILD_AMD64 conditional
    - fix typo in opens___.ttf installing
    - uncomment LD_ASSUME_KERNEL call, was uncommented for testing and then
      not reenabled again....
    - the mono support is now enabled per default in ooo-build; disable it
      (still needs the .dll's from the OOo windows installset)
    - build hicontrast iconset
    - install libkab1.so into -kde
  * debian/control*.in:
    - add openoffice.org2-hunspell
    - -dev Recommends: java-gcj-compat-dev
    - Suggest also libmysql-java | libpg-java | libsapdbc7.5.01-java
      (JDBC Drivers) at -base
    - Suggest g++-4.0 | g++-3.4 at -dev instead of the other way round,
      request of Mattias Klose
    - let -base Depend on java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime insteadf
      of just Recommending it since the internal db needs it. Recommend
      java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime on -writer for the
      Java-needing features. Substitute gij-4.0 dependency on -jars-native
      with java-gcj-compat, too
    - let -core Conflict against openoffice.orgVER-unbundled (provided by the
      official OOo packages from Sun) to prevent a openoffice.org-writer
      sneaking in which would fullfill our dependencies when these packages
      are openoffice.org-* but wouldn't work at all together with "the rest"
      of our packages. Provide openoffice.orgVER-bundled as the counterpart -
      the packages from Sun conflict against it.
    - add @FONT_SUGGESTS@
    - s/myspell-dictionary-@CODE@/myspell-dictionary-@LCODE@/, oops
    - add Architecture: all to ttf-opensymbol...
    - remove unixodbc builddeps for Debian, unixodbc-dev uninstallable
    - add %AMD64%, substituted by amd64 if we want to build amd64, too
    - Standards-Version: 3.6.2 (no changes needed)
    - mention KDE Addressbook integration at -kde and Suggest kaddressbook
    - temporaryily let -common depend on -l10n-en-us until some package split
      issues are sorted out...
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: add lintian overrides
     - binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath, we use RPATH to OOo own dir; makes sense
       here
     - menu-icon-missing, bogus warning, the icons are in -common and not
       in -writer, -calc, etc
     - menu-item-contains-unknown-tag, kderemove="y" *is* a valid tag
  * debian/javasettings*xml: remove, useless

      now in...); remove Build-Dep on xlibs-static-pic

    - build-depend on gcj-4.0 (>= 4.0.1) and gij-4.0 (>= 4.0.1) and remove
      explicit build-dep on binutils (>= 2.16) since gcj-4.0 depends on gcc-4.0

    libfreetype (X 4.3, Gnome 2 etc.) [CH]

openoffice.org (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove duplicate English templates/autocorrect/styles in other language packs
    (closes: #155487, #171515, #177903. #177993, #179346)
  * Re-enable system libfreetype, thanks to Gwenole Beauchesne for pointing us
    to the problem.  New patch: 034_rename_inflate (closes: #179912)
  * Make the package build without modification on Woody:
    + Build-Depends: g++ (>=3.2.2) | g++-3.2 | g++-3.0 [!powerpc]
    + Automatically detect whether to use gcc. gcc-3.2 or gcc-3.0 as compiler
    + Make memmgr.cxx patch needed for gcc-3.0 conditional.
      New patch: 907_gcc3.0_memmgr
    + Remove libstdc++ from MANIFEST lists, since this is not used and the
      filename is different on Woody
  * Change Build-Depends: libstdc++3[!powerpc] to [i386]
  * Add documentation of buildprj target in debian/rules
  * fix typo in package description (closes: #179301)

    foreign languages, reducing the space needed to build the packages by
    about 1.5Gb.  New patch: 908_scpzip_dontpackswitch
  * openoffice-dpack-lang: Generate langpacks directly from the solver instead
    of unpacking from the installation sets.  Hardlink files where possible to
    save space.
  * Add support for 'instsetext' setting, which controls which installation
    sets are created.  Binary-only builds no longer need to create extra
    installation sets.  New patch: 032_select_instsets
  * Patch 031_define_fixes is back, thanks to Gwenole Beauchesne for updating
    to 1.0.2
  * Patch 030_officecfg_userjavavar: Unhardcode Java compiler from 'java' to
    $JAVA
  * Check that /proc exists before starting the build.

    crashes idlc when there is no /proc.
  * Document the changed build targets in debian/README
  * Reduce disk usage during build by ~0.5Gb by adding a -link option to
    deliver.pl which links files in the solver instead of copying.
    New patch: 035_deliver_linkopt
  * Use system libstlport, but only if the gcc transition has taken place.
    Enforced by Build-Depends: libstlport4.5-full(>= 4.5.3-9) | g++ (<< 3.2.2)
  * Remove Build-Conflicts: libgcj[23]-dev.  This was fixed upstream in 1.0.2.
  * The hook script has moved to /usr/share/openoffice.org-debian-files.
    dependencies tightened for smooth upgrades

  * Remove non-free LZW compression code: Save to html no longer works if
    there are graphics in the document.

  * link /usr/bin/ooffice -> openoffice for consistency with other command
    names, other distro packages and for Evolution (thanks Jack Howarth)
  * Redirect bug reports for subpackages to openoffice.org until the BTS knows
    about the packages
  * debian/rules: create 2 new clean targets to recover disk space without
    cleaning the whole build: clean-debdir (850M) and clean-instsetoo (2.5Gb).

    - delete patch 005_gcc3_misc_changes, because it is not needed for PowerPC
      and this patch was only PowerPC related.
  * Update description with text from upstream's FAQ and mention spelling
    dictionaries
  * Conflict openoffice.org[-bin] against <= 1.0.1-2 because of the files that
    moved
  * Suggest openoffice.org-spellcheck-<lang> in all language packs, and
    explain about dictionaries in the langpack descriptions

  * Change user directory to ~/OpenOffice.org1.0.1.  Note there is 
    *no support* from upstream to upgrade the user directory, and I have seen
     too much corruption from 1.0.0 to be prepared to attempt to support it in

  * Jan- Hendrik Palic:
    - Switched to gcc-3.1/g++3.1 to build OpenOffice.org on PPC.  i386 does
      not work with gcc-3.1 yet.
    - much work on the patches:
      + all changes to oo_1.0_src/config_office/configure.in went to
        001_configure.in_gcc-3.x-fixes.diff
         o set compilervars
         o detecting the right include for gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
         o java will be detected right on powerpc, so we can build
           automaticly, without setting the location of javac twice
      + link against -lstlport_gcc_3.1 (soname changed in libstlport)
        this went into 011_link_agains_stlport_gcc_3.1.diff
      + 005_gcc3_misc_changes.diff did the last changes to compile
        OpenOffice.org by gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
      + 010_use_libstdc++_from_debian.diff is changed to use this patch with
        OpenOffice.org-1.0.1
    - debian/rules:
      + copies the mozlibs into source from some place (sorry,no package yet)
        but I will link OpenOffice.org again mozilla 1.0 from debian
        (I have to recompile Mozilla with gcc-3.1/g++3.1)
    - debian/control
      + fixes the builddependencies for using gcc-3.1/g++-3.1 for all arches.
      + added buildconflict to libgcj3-dev
    - killed extra-dependencies on debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - sets USE_GCC3 to y in debian/script/vars.powerpc

       016_fontcache_copy_weight.diff, 021_lingu_cvsupdates.diff,
       022_psprint_fontmanager.diff
    - New patch: 015_dont_unset_home.diff - removes unset HOME so ccache works
      again
    - Properly detect GNOME2 session manager, thanks to Gary Coady
    - Remove languages from oo-xlate-lang that are not yet available
      (ca and fi)
    - link against -lstlport_gcc_3.x (soname changed in libstlport) - this was
      one of the showstoppers for getting OOo into main.  Correct lib is
      determined from the compiler in use
    - Fix patch.unapply to work with arch dir
    - Make patch.apply pipe *.uu patches through uudecode for binary patches
    - set SAL_DEBUG=strace or gdb for debugging

  * Revert 903_system_freetype.diff - the OpenSymbol font can not be displayed
    unless you use a font server, which means most users will not be able to
    use bullets.  This appears to be some problem with the different
    libfreetype versions.  Spadmin will crash if you try to add the
    OpenSymbol font directly, and I cannot see what is going on in gdb without
    creating a debug build.

          + Use SAL_FONTPATH_USER for user font path
    - 903_system_freetype.diff
          + Use the system libfreetype instead of the internal library
  * Chris Halls:
    - openoffice.org-bin conflicts with earlier packages (<= -3)

    - Remove LANGLIST=01 from response files
    - Move arch-specific dependencies to openoffice.org-bin
    - Patch 904_libodbc_soname.diff: dlopen libodbc.so.1 instead of
      libodbc.so.  Added unixodbc to Suggests.  Thanks to Steve Langasek for
      the help.
    - Add Suggests: cupsys-bsd.  With this package installed, printer queues

    - Build foreign languages
    - Split off architecture-dependent files into openoffice.org-bin
      package and depend on it.  This package will not need to be updated as
      frequently as the main openoffice.org package.
    - Remove workaround for libstdc in rules, because patch
      902_remove_libstdc_from_scp solves the problem.
    - Use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles.  Build-depend on debhelper >=
      4.0.9 because of a problem with globbing with dh_install
    - Build-depend on perl-base because perl is used in some scripts

    - Update README.Debian and TODO
    - Workaround for issue #4494: unset SESSION_MANAGER if session manager is
      gnome-session

openoffice.org (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Chris Halls:
    - Remove desktop integration from default setup so we can do it ourselves
      as described in sections C-E of
      http://installation.openoffice.org/how_to_repackage_oo.html
      This removes the error messages reported by users during setup (except
      for one about mathdoc.desktop - this is an upstream problem).  It also
      removes the menu entries in the KDE menus... ahem!
    - Add a small README, describing how to get started and mentioning the
      fact that some problems and workarounds are in TODO.Debian.
    - debian/rules: OOo setup now returns exit code 0 when happy, so remove
      the workaround
    - Updated TODO tasks
  * John M Cooper:
    - Add mime support for native files
