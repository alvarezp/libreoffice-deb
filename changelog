        . Crash in WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem (CVE-2010-3454)
        . Crash in SwRTFParser::ReadNumSecLevel (CVE-2010-3452)

  * debian/patches/buildfix-patches.diff:
    openoffice.org-report-builder -> libreoffice-report-builder
  * debian/patches/hack-no-rm-fr-of-smoketest-userconfig.diff: don't try
    to remove user dir on smokest, rm -f -r mysteriously fails

  * debian/control.in:
    - make -math depend on ttf-opensymbol (>> 2:2.4.3~) (closes: #603203)
    - remove build-dep on imagemagick
    - replace old openoffice.org-{base,math,draw,impress,common,kde,writer,calc}
      (closes: #602866)
    - stop build-depending on libpam0g-dev, pam-needing stuff gone
  * debian/copyright:
    - update again, it's actually supposed to be "Copyright (c) 2000, 2010
      LibreOffice contributors and/or their affiliates."
    - add dmake/dbug/*, thanks Alexander Schmehl
  * debian/rules:
    - revert system-{graphite,cppunit,stlport} changes in 1:3.3.0~beta2-2
    - stop building with --enable-hids per default again, slows down  the build
      and we don't use the VCL Testtool anyway
    - use new --enable-broffice
    - remove manual installing of LibO splash (LibO now also supports intro.png)
    - update .desktop file/icon installation to actually give sensible results
      (Exec= and Icon=; fix up broffice.org changes) (closes: #602883)
    - stop trying to change the product name in ooo*.res and versionrc;
      apparently it is not needed anymore (and doing so breaks BrOffice.org
      About) (closes: #602868)
    - we need to explicitly add --enable-build-unowinreg now
    - also disable the "subsequent tests" on non-openjdk builds
  * debian/broffice.org.p*.in: adapt diversions for new intro.png;
    remove ooo*.res/versionrc diversions
  * debian/soffice-template.desktop.in: update for LibreOffice and ..

    backports to debian-backports@l.d.o 
  * debian/rules, debian/control.in: hi-IN -> hi 
  * debian/watch: update to look for libreoffice-build 
  * debian/smoketest/smoketest-disable-db-insert-delete-seek-tests.diff:
    rediff (closes: #603008) 
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: remove .org from BrOffice stuff

libreoffice (1:3.3.0~beta2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in:
    - add missing build-depends on automake 
  * debian/rules, control.lenny_squeeze_transitional.in:
    - remove lenny->squeeze transitional packages, obsolete and not
      needed here anyways with the OOo -> LibO move
  * debian/rules:
    - temporarily disable system-{graphite,cppunit,stlport} on i386,
      will be reeenabled when beta3 included the necessary patches to
      make this work
    - fix clean to remove some generated localize-related files
  * debian/copyright: update

libreoffice (1:3.3.0~beta2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * welcome, LibreOffice 3.3 beta 2 (aka 3.2.99.2)
    - includes OpenOffice.org 3.3.0 release branch milestone 9, so:
      + fixes hebrew text in sheet tabs when using system fonts
        (closes: #433231)
      + fixes directory traversal vulnerability in OOo (CVE-2010-3450)

  * switch to new LibreOffice build infrastructure (more or less ooo-build,
    though), update Homepage:.
    LO uses own splash, so this indirectly closes: #529709

  * debian/*: loads of OpenOffice.org -> LibreOffice changes

  * debian/rules:
    - add and rework target(s) for new external sources handling upstream
    - updates for (OOo) 3.3 and its various configuration changes
    - move oo-*ldap.xcd.sample to /usr/share/openoffice.org-common/examples
    - unpack extensions to /usr/lib/openoffice/share/extensions instead of
      shipping the oxt
    - adapt jar locations to actually match Java policy: public jars
      inside /usr/share/java (and /usr/lib/ure/...) and "internal" ones
      to /usr/share/java/basisX.Y/program/classes. Keep the symlinks there
    - remove WITH_SPLIT option, upstream vanilla tarballs not supported by
      new ooo-build build anymore
    - temporarily disable -sdbc-postgresql as unopkg apparently has problems
      with .zips now...
    - use convert directly for copnverting to 24bpp bmp instead of using fix_bmp_rgb
    - opens___.ttf has an own version number; reflect this in the package version
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: adapt for "Test Cleanup". Build-depend
    on libcppunit-dev and junit4. Remove xvfb.
  * debian/*.{pre,post},{inst,rm}.in, debian/shell-lib-{components,extensions}:
    cleanup. remove unused THIS_SCRIPT. Use dpkgs DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE
    instead of THIS_SCRIPT
  * debian/shell-lib-extensions.sh: remove add_extension(), not needed anymore;
    add new validate_extensions() and sync_extensions()
  * debian/*.postinst.in, debian/*.prerm.in: Remove unopkg calls for
    extensions in prerm and postinst, as we don't need them anymore
  * debian/control*in: remove Pre-Depends: on openoffice.orgVER-common
  * debian/*.preinst.in: when upgrading from a m84 or newer, don't run unopkg
    remove anymore
  * debian/control.in:
    - move binfilter to suggests (and remove from openoffice.orgs
      Description), it is not in the default install anymore
    - generalize -style-* Breaks: in common to always break -style-*
      (<< ${basis-version}) and add a Breaks on (>= 1:{next-basis-version})
      so that we don't "loose" icons because of not-matching basis. Thanks
      Michael Tokarev for pointing this out.
  * debian/uno-libs3.symbols: update
  * debian/icons: remove again
  * debian/broffice.org*: update diversions
  * debian/Recovery.xcu: remove, we now need to to this in main.xcd
  * debian/rules, debian/scripts/vars.powerpcspe: add powerpcspe support
    (Sebastian Andrzej Siewior)  - closes: #594038
  * debian/openoffice.org-common.triggers, debian/shell-lib-extensions.sh:
    add trigger for openoffice.org-common to run unopkg sync after all
    extensions in /usr/lib/openoffice/share/extensions have been
    installed/updated
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: stop building industrial package 
  * debian/scripts/fix_bmp_rgb: remove 
  * debian/catalog.xml: move ...
