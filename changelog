    are not available if served by a font server.
  * link /usr/bin/ooffice -> openoffice for consistency with other command
    names, other distro packages and for Evolution (thanks Jack Howarth)
  * Redirect bug reports for subpackages to openoffice.org until the BTS knows
    about the packages
  * debian/rules: create 2 new clean targets to recover disk space without
    cleaning the whole build: clean-debdir (850M) and clean-instsetoo (2.5Gb).

    appear multiple times.

    - delete patch 005_gcc3_misc_changes, because it is not needed for PowerPC
      and this patch was only PowerPC related.
  * Update description with text from upstream's FAQ and mention spelling
    dictionaries
  * Conflict openoffice.org[-bin] against <= 1.0.1-2 because of the files that
    moved

openoffice.org (1.0.0-pre1.0.1rc2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Recompiled against fixed libstlport package
  * Change user directory to ~/OpenOffice.org1.0.1.  Note there is 
    *no support* from upstream to upgrade the user directory, and I have seen
     too much corruption from 1.0.0 to be prepared to attempt to support it in
     just these packages, so you must change your user settings by hand for
     now.  The openoffice wrapper will warn if it sees ~/.openoffice still.
  * Update some sections of README

openoffice.org (1.0.0-pre1.0.1rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream: 1.0.1 release candidate
      (from CVS OpenOffice_1_0_1 of 7/3/2002)
  * Jan- Hendrik Palic:
    - Switched to gcc-3.1/g++3.1 to build OpenOffice.org on PPC.  i386 does
      not work with gcc-3.1 yet.
    - much work on the patches:
      + all changes to oo_1.0_src/config_office/configure.in went to
        001_configure.in_gcc-3.x-fixes.diff
         o set compilervars
         o detecting the right include for gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
         o java will be detected right on powerpc, so we can build
           automaticly, without setting the location of javac twice
      + link against -lstlport_gcc_3.1 (soname changed in libstlport)
        this went into 011_link_agains_stlport_gcc_3.1.diff
      + 005_gcc3_misc_changes.diff did the last changes to compile
        OpenOffice.org by gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
      + 010_use_libstdc++_from_debian.diff is changed to use this patch with
        OpenOffice.org-1.0.1
    - debian/rules:
      + copies the mozlibs into source from some place (sorry,no package yet)
        but I will link OpenOffice.org again mozilla 1.0 from debian
        (I have to recompile Mozilla with gcc-3.1/g++3.1)
    - debian/control
      + fixes the builddependencies for using gcc-3.1/g++-3.1 for all arches.
      + added buildconflict to libgcj3-dev
    - killed extra-dependencies on debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - sets USE_GCC3 to y in debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - changed debian/rules to use gcc-3.1
  * Chris Halls
    - Fix errors like openoffice: [: it-CH: binary operator expected
    - Remove patches integrated upstream:
       008_clk_tck_gcc-3.diff, 015_setup_oognomeappmath.diff,
       016_fontcache_copy_weight.diff, 021_lingu_cvsupdates.diff,
       022_psprint_fontmanager.diff
    - New patch: 015_dont_unset_home.diff - removes unset HOME so ccache works
      again
    - Properly detect GNOME2 session manager, thanks to Gary Coady
    - Remove languages from oo-xlate-lang that are not yet available
      (ca and fi)
    - link against -lstlport_gcc_3.x (soname changed in libstlport) - this was
      one of the showstoppers for getting OOo into main.  Correct lib is
      determined from the compiler in use
    - Fix patch.unapply to work with arch dir
    - Make patch.apply pipe *.uu patches through uudecode for binary patches
    - set SAL_DEBUG=strace or gdb for debugging
    - move global dictionary.lst into /etc/openoffice
    - openoffice.org Suggests openoffice.org-spellcheck
    - ooo-l10n-de Suggests German dictionaries

openoffice.org (1.0.0-6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix names of suggested ooqstart-gnome and update-mime
  * Revert 903_system_freetype.diff - the OpenSymbol font can not be displayed
    unless you use a font server, which means most users will not be able to
    use bullets.  This appears to be some problem with the different
    libfreetype versions.  Spadmin will crash if you try to add the
    OpenSymbol font directly, and I cannot see what is going on in gdb without
    creating a debug build.
  * Move libmozab libraries to -bin package

 -- Chris Halls <chris.halls@gmx.de>  Tue, 25 Jun 2002 17:57:22 +0200

          + Use SAL_FONTPATH_USER for user font path
    - 903_system_freetype.diff
          + Use the system libfreetype instead of the internal library
  * Chris Halls:
    - openoffice.org-bin conflicts with earlier packages (<= -3)

    - Remove LANGLIST=01 from response files
    - Move arch-specific dependencies to openoffice.org-bin
    - Patch 904_libodbc_soname.diff: dlopen libodbc.so.1 instead of
      libodbc.so.  Added unixodbc to Suggests.  Thanks to Steve Langasek for
      the help.
    - Add Suggests: cupsys-bsd.  With this package installed, printer queues
      will appear in the print dialog without having to use spadmin.
    - Lots of updates to README.Debian and TODO
    - Update package description

    - Fix mime support (update-mime was not called in postinst)
    - Build foreign languages

    - Remove workaround for libstdc in rules, because patch
      902_remove_libstdc_from_scp solves the problem.
    - Use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles.  Build-depend on debhelper >=

      This removes the error messages reported by users during setup (except
