openoffice.org (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Chris Halls:
    - Remove desktop integration from default setup so we can do it ourselves
      as described in sections C-E of
      http://installation.openoffice.org/how_to_repackage_oo.html
      This removes the error messages reported by users during setup (except
      for one about mathdoc.desktop - this is an upstream problem).  It also
      removes the menu entries in the KDE menus... ahem!
    - Add a small README, describing how to get started and mentioning the
      fact that some problems and workarounds are in TODO.Debian.
    - debian/rules: OOo setup now returns exit code 0 when happy, so remove
      the workaround
    - Updated TODO tasks
  * John M Cooper:
    - Add mime support for native files

    - Removed XFree references from README and TODO
