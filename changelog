  * Re-enable system libfreetype, thanks to Gwenole Beauchesne for pointing us
    to the problem.  New patch: 034_rename_inflate (closes: #179912)

  * Redirect bug reports for subpackages to openoffice.org until the BTS knows
    about the packages
  * debian/rules: create 2 new clean targets to recover disk space without
    cleaning the whole build: clean-debdir (850M) and clean-instsetoo (2.5Gb).

  * Update description with text from upstream's FAQ and mention spelling
    dictionaries

  * Jan- Hendrik Palic:
    - Switched to gcc-3.1/g++3.1 to build OpenOffice.org on PPC.  i386 does
      not work with gcc-3.1 yet.
    - much work on the patches:
      + all changes to oo_1.0_src/config_office/configure.in went to
        001_configure.in_gcc-3.x-fixes.diff
         o set compilervars
         o detecting the right include for gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
         o java will be detected right on powerpc, so we can build
           automaticly, without setting the location of javac twice
      + link against -lstlport_gcc_3.1 (soname changed in libstlport)
        this went into 011_link_agains_stlport_gcc_3.1.diff
      + 005_gcc3_misc_changes.diff did the last changes to compile
        OpenOffice.org by gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
      + 010_use_libstdc++_from_debian.diff is changed to use this patch with
        OpenOffice.org-1.0.1
    - debian/rules:
      + copies the mozlibs into source from some place (sorry,no package yet)
        but I will link OpenOffice.org again mozilla 1.0 from debian
        (I have to recompile Mozilla with gcc-3.1/g++3.1)
    - debian/control
      + fixes the builddependencies for using gcc-3.1/g++-3.1 for all arches.
      + added buildconflict to libgcj3-dev
    - killed extra-dependencies on debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - sets USE_GCC3 to y in debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - changed debian/rules to use gcc-3.1
  * Chris Halls

       016_fontcache_copy_weight.diff, 021_lingu_cvsupdates.diff,
       022_psprint_fontmanager.diff
    - New patch: 015_dont_unset_home.diff - removes unset HOME so ccache works
      again
    - Properly detect GNOME2 session manager, thanks to Gary Coady
    - Remove languages from oo-xlate-lang that are not yet available
      (ca and fi)
    - link against -lstlport_gcc_3.x (soname changed in libstlport) - this was
      one of the showstoppers for getting OOo into main.  Correct lib is
      determined from the compiler in use
    - Fix patch.unapply to work with arch dir
    - Make patch.apply pipe *.uu patches through uudecode for binary patches
    - set SAL_DEBUG=strace or gdb for debugging

    use bullets.  This appears to be some problem with the different

    - Correct l10n typo in README.Debian
    - Build-depend on libfreetype6-dev

openoffice.org (1.0.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * John M Cooper:
    - Add Debian menu entries
  * Jan-Hendrik Palic:
    - Update JDK home directory for PPC
  * Chris Halls:
    - Fix mime support (update-mime was not called in postinst)
    - Build foreign languages
    - Split off architecture-dependent files into openoffice.org-bin
      package and depend on it.  This package will not need to be updated as
      frequently as the main openoffice.org package.
    - Remove workaround for libstdc in rules, because patch
      902_remove_libstdc_from_scp solves the problem.
    - Use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles.  Build-depend on debhelper >=
      4.0.9 because of a problem with globbing with dh_install
    - Build-depend on perl-base because perl is used in some scripts
    - Add instsetoo target to recreate install sets
    - Update README.Debian and TODO
    - Workaround for issue #4494: unset SESSION_MANAGER if session manager is
      gnome-session
    - Make Menu entries use openoffice wrapper. spadmin can be run from the
      menu and setup is removed from the menu.
  * Patches copied from Gwenole Beauchesne at Mandrake:
    - 015_setup_oognomeappmath: fix error message on user setup
    - 016_fontcache_copy_weight: Fix bug in font cache (font when printed
      appear bold etc, IZ #4366)
    - 902_remove_libstdc_from_scp.diff: also remove libgcc_s.so from .deb
  * Martin Quinson:
    - Foreign language support!
    - Generate multiple packages and control file for lanaguage support
      automatically.
    - Adapt openoffice-xlate-lang and openoffice-dpack-lang from Mandrake's
      packages

openoffice.org (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Chris Halls:
    - Remove desktop integration from default setup so we can do it ourselves
      as described in sections C-E of
      http://installation.openoffice.org/how_to_repackage_oo.html
      This removes the error messages reported by users during setup (except
      for one about mathdoc.desktop - this is an upstream problem).  It also
      removes the menu entries in the KDE menus... ahem!
    - Add a small README, describing how to get started and mentioning the
      fact that some problems and workarounds are in TODO.Debian.
    - debian/rules: OOo setup now returns exit code 0 when happy, so remove
      the workaround
    - Updated TODO tasks

    - Add mime support for native files
