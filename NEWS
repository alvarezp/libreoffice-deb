openoffice.org (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As part of the integration of Ximian's work, openoffice
    now uses fontconfig to determine the installed fonts on
    your system.  Fonts that were installed using the 'spadmin'
    tool in a non-standard directory are no longer supported.
    You should move those fonts to a directory that fontconfig
    knows about, such as ~/.fonts or /usr/share/fonts.
