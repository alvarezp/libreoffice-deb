Description: CLI binding for OpenOffice.org
 OpenOffice.org is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package contains the CLI bindings to OpenOffice.org for
 accessing the OpenOffice.org API from Mono languages (e.g. C# and Boo)
 .
 Note that currently the use of Mono for add-ins & scripting inside
 OpenOffice.org is *not* yet supported.
