Description: high-quality office productivity suite
 OpenOffice.org 1.0 is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office. Users report that little
 or no training is required for people migrating from other office suites -
 everything works the way people expect.
 .
 The free office productivity software suite features key desktop applications
 - including word processor, spreadsheet, presentation and drawing programs -
 in more than 25 languages. In addition, OpenOffice.org 1.0 works transparently
 with a variety of file formats, enabling users to exchange documents freely
 with users of with other office suites, such as Microsoft Office and
 StarOffice [tm] 6.0 software. OpenOffice.org 1.0 software runs stably and
 natively on multiple platforms, including Linux, PPC Linux, Solaris [tm],
 Windows and many other flavors of nix.This makes it an ideal first step in a
 migration strategy towards completely open-source computing.
 .
 OpenOffice.org 1.0 is the culmination of more than 18 months of collaborative
 effort by members of the OpenOffice.org community, which is comprised of Sun
 employees, volunteers, CollabNet, and end users, all working to create a
 world-class international office suite that will run on all major platforms.
 .
 Written in C++ and with documented APIs licensed under the LGPL and SISSL Open
 Source licenses, OpenOffice.org allows any knowledgeable developer to benefit
 from the source. And, because the file format for OpenOffice.org is XML,
 interoperability is easy, making future development and adoption more certain.
 .
