 Spelling dictionaries other than US English are not distributed with the
 main OpenOffice.org source due to licensing differences.  There are some
 available in separate packages (openoffice.org-spellcheck-<language>).
 If you just want to be able to spellcheck in other languages, you can
 install extra dictionaries independently of the language packs.
